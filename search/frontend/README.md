# Search

Search client runtime library derived from [stork search](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork).

The wasm files are built in the main repository and must be available at `../hypertext/components/search/pkg` so they can be copied over to create the `dist` folder for testing.

# Development

Run `yarn run` to see all the different build and test options.

You can read more documentation and learn more about customization at the project's website: <https://stork-search.net>.

To download the test data source (text file versions of the first 20 Federalist Papers), visit [the Federalist Papers](https://github.com/jameslittle230/federalist) repository.
